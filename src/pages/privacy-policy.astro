      We sincerely believe that you should always know what data we collect from

        interact with us; and (ii) the rights that you have to determine the
        contours of this interaction.

          <p><b>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
          <p>
            We implement industry-standard technical and organizational measures
            by using a variety of security technologies and procedures to help
            protect your data from unauthorized access, use, loss, destruction
            or disclosure. When we collect particularly sensitive data (such as
            a credit card number or your geo-location), it is encrypted using
            industry-standard cryptographic techniques including but not limited
            to SSL, TLS, RSA, and AES.

            Your password is your first line of defense once you set up a
            LeadSquared account, so we recommend that you set a strong password
            which you never share with anyone and ensure you sign out of your
            LeadSquared account once you have used that same.
